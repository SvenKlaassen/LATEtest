Description: Assumptions sufficient for the identification of local average treatment
    effects (LATEs) generate necessary conditions which allow to refute instrument
    validity. The degree of violations of instrument validity likely varies across 
    subpopulations. This package uses causal forests to search and test for local 
    violations of the LATE assumptions in a data-driven way. See the LATEtest website
    on GitHub for more information, documentation and examples.
